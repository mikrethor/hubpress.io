:hp-alt-title: Why I use asciidoc to take my notes

For some time now I have used asciidoc to write all my notes.
I even use asciidoc to write this blog.

My main use case was that I wanted to be able to send a proper report of what I was doing especially when investing a problem.
I took this habit while working with an architect who sent a note to the project manager at the end of each day when working on a problem.
This note contained all his paths of research.
Such note was really helpful when you had to work on the problem after him.

The advantages I find in using asciidoc are :

* Clear syntax (http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[quick syntax])
* Can generate proper output in many formats
* Can easily be reused in a project documentation
* Only need a simple text editor

I had to find some disadvantages :

* Need to have some tools installed to use all the features
* Have to learn the syntax to properly modify a note

For me no better argument than an example to really show you why I use asciidoc :

To properly and easily access my notes I push them in a git repository but I have heard about using asciidoc with Evenote (https://emmanuelbernard.com/blog/2017/03/28/evernote-and-vim/[asciidoc vim Evernote]).
