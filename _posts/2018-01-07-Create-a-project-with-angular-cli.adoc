Angular/cli can be used to create an angular project with the latest module versions.
In the first place, we have to install angular/cli.

[source,sh]
----
npm install -g @angular/cli
----

In case angular/cli is already installed, it can be updated using the following command.

[source,sh]
----
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
----

In case npm is not globally installed use this command.

[source,sh]
----
npm i -g npm
----

To create the project use ng new.

[source,sh]
----
ng new myproject
----

In order to launch the project, we have to use the ng serve command inside the myproject folder.

[source,sh]
----
cd myproject
ng serve
----

Et voil√†!
