A few weeks ago, I decided to change the default osmc password to something more secure.
Of course I managed to forget this secured password.
Fortunately for me there is a way to reset it without damaging anything.

1.   Stop your raspberry
2.   Remove your sdcard and plug it in another computer
3.   On the sdcard edit the file cmdline.txt
4.   Write init=/bin/bash at the end of the first line
5.   Save the file and plug back the sdcard in your raspberry
6.   Power the RB and Run passwd osmc
7.   Change your password
8.   Remove init=/bin/bash the same you used to write it in the cmdline.txt
9.   Et voil√†

Have fun.
