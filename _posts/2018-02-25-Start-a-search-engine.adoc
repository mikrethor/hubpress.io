:hp-alt-title: Start a search engine

In our web application we have a search functionality which is based on SQL requests.
It works ok but it's really hard to test, maintain and optimize.

There is a better way : a search engine.

I have worked with the search engine Elastic Search before and I find it really easy to use.
But I have never used it integrated in a webapp.

To start using Elastic Search in our webapp, I am going to extract data from our db2 database and visualize it in Kibana.

Download Elastic, Kibana and Logstash













In an other post, I will write about the webapp integration.
