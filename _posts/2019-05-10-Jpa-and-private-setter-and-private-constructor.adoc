Today, with my colleagues, I talked about Oriented Programming and why we shouldn't always generate all the getters and setters when we design a class (https://www.javaworld.com/article/2073723/why-getter-and-setter-methods-are-evil.html[Why getter and setter methods are evil?]).
And someone told me that JPA forces us to declare setters and getters in an entity class. Does it?

== What is the JPA requirements for an entity class

=== No setter ?

When an entity class doesn't contain a setter for a field, JPA will raise the following error :

....
org.hibernate.PropertyNotFoundException: Could not locate setter method for property 
....

=== No constructor ?

When an entity class doesn't contain a constructor without parameters, JPA will raise the following error :

....
org.hibernate.InstantiationException: No default constructor for entity: 
....

== Conclusion

JPA needs a constructor and setter for each declared field. Does it mean we have to expose the default constructor and each setter ?

It doesn't...

JPA supports private constructor and private setters.

@Entity
public class Person {
  private long id;
  private String name;

  public Person(long id, String name) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
  }

  private Person() {
  }

  @Id
  public long getId() {
    return id;
  }

  private void setId(long id) {
    this.id = id;
  }

  @Column
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  private void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

This entity is a valid JPA entity and it can't be modified after its creation.
