:hp-alt-title: From JBake to Hubpress

Somedays ago I watched a 2015 Devoxx Fr Video about Asciidoc and Hubpress and  I chose to migrate my blog from JBake to Hubpress.

Already liked Asciidoc but I was not totally satisfied with JBake so I decided to give Hubpress a try. Will tell you about it after some posts.
