Coming from the Java world, I am used to use Log Framework in my projects. I was fed up of using the following.

[source,ts]
----
console.log("Stuff to log");
----

So, I looked for Log framework in Angular world and I came accross   https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-logger[NgxLogger].
For people coming from Jave, NgxLogger is like Log4j. 
The mains advantages of NgxLogger are :

- Several log levels
- Switching log easily
