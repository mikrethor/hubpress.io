Last week, I had the chance to attend to the Vaadin talk by @marcushellberg (Marcus Hellberg) hosted by the Montreal Jug.
I have been so impressed that I am pretty sure I will write my next webapp with Vaadin.
I decided to give Vaadin a try and get back to Angular if I am not convinced.
My choice is mainly based on two facts :

* I am more productive in Java than in Angular
* Vaadin is a pretty mature

Vaadin is Rich Internet Application framework first released in year 2002.
In 2007 the  the product license was changed to open source Apache License 2.0.
The version 8 of Vaadin just came out two month ago with many enhancements.
Such as :

* Re-written data binding API utilizing modern Java features, such as type parameters and lambda expressions
* CPU and memory improvements

To help you see what Vaadin can help you do, you can watch this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUBt8k4pQgQ[Vaadin 8].
This is mostly the same presentation I saw at Montreal Jug.

You can find the code of the demo on Github. Follow this https://github.com/vaadin-marcus/spring-boot-todo[link].

I was able to develop the note app in a bit more of time than Marcus but I did it in less than an hour.
From this starting point, I am learning through the Vaadin https://vaadin.com/docs/[documentation]
